    </p>Before returning to Florida for spring break I planned to ask my father if he wanted to do anything special. It was his 53rd birthday that same week and while I'm fortunate to have a good relationship with my dad, it's rare we actuallyâ€¦do anything together. My brother is his best friend. If sports are on, they're together, and it's nearly impossible to break them away from whatever New York team is on the TV. But his break from college wasn't until the following week, so for seven days I was an only child. <br><br>
	While I planned to ask him what he wanted, I figured it may be better to have it be a surprise. This of course relied on my mother subtly asking if there was any sort of activity he had any desire to participate in, which she subsequently forgot to do every time I hung up with her. So I am not to blame for the events that followed. When I arrived home I bit the bullet and just told him I wanted to do something. This led to absolutely nothing happening for the next five days. Because of course, it did. I was really about to give up on doing anything at all, I was pretty much fine with the usual stay-at-home and play video games routine. But finally, my dad stopped by my room and said he signed us up for a painting class that evening. <br><br>
	In reality, I probably shouldn't be as surprised as I was. My family knows about my passion for art. I've been drawing for years now, and while I keep it mostly to myself I do show them a few of my pieces every now and again. But what I forgot entirely was that my dad was a bit of an artist too. He, like me, drew throughout his childhood. I had even seen most of the sketches he kept once in a manilla folder in some closet somewhere, but that was years ago now. <br><br>
	The class he picked was one where a young girl in her twenties attempted to teach a group of forty-year-old women on their third glass of wine how to paint a highland cow. My dad and I were also there. However, there is another thing we have in common. The ability to make anything entertaining. The painting itself was fun, but watching a menagerie of drunk soccer moms try to create artistic masterpieces in less than two hours was beautiful. They were loud and obnoxious, and I can't be asked to repeat anything they said when one spilled their cup on someone else's canvas, but my introverted father and I had a blast in our little corner. Our paintings weren't that bad either! My cow was a bit more tomato-colored than I would have liked, and dad got quite a big splotch of green on his head, but you could tell they were cows! So the goal was accomplished really. And we got out just in time for my dad to be home for the Knicks game. <br></p>
