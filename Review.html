    <p> When it comes to evaluating the strength of a tool in any capacity, the first criterion that comes to mind is its ability to perform the tasks that are expected and required of it. In this case, ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence language model, is meant to interpret the prompt its user gives it and provide a response best suited to what is being asked of it. The AI can answer questions you'd usually do a quick Google search on, explain topics in further detail, and even spit out entire essays if asked. So, in order to evaluate its effectiveness, I asked ChatGPT to do this assignment for me. The following bolded text was its response to the prompt: "Write a Review on ChatGPT."
<b></b>
        
	"As an AI language model developed by OpenAI, ChatGPT is one of the most impressive technological achievements of recent years. Having been trained on a vast corpus of human language data, ChatGPT is capable of producing coherent and engaging responses to a wide variety of questions and prompts.
<b></b>
        
One of the standout features of ChatGPT is its ability to understand natural language, including idiomatic expressions, colloquialisms, and sarcasm. This makes it a particularly effective tool for engaging in conversational interactions, whether for educational, informational, or entertainment purposes.
<b></b>
        
Another strength of ChatGPT is its adaptability. By leveraging its neural network architecture, ChatGPT is able to learn from each new interaction and continuously improve its responses over time. This means that users can expect more accurate and nuanced answers to their questions as they continue to engage with the platform.
<b></b>
        
Of course, like any technology, ChatGPT is not without its limitations. While it is capable of processing and understanding a wide range of inputs, it is still fundamentally limited by the data it has been trained on. This means that there may be some questions or prompts that ChatGPT is not equipped to handle, particularly in niche or specialized domains.
<b></b>
    
Overall, though, ChatGPT represents a major milestone in the development of AI language models. With its sophisticated natural language processing capabilities and adaptive neural network architecture, it is a powerful tool for engaging in conversational interactions and accessing information in new and exciting ways."
<b></b>
        
Now you may be wondering what the point of this was. Part of you may be saying, "of course, you picked the AI, it did all the work for you." And you'd be half right. I would be lying if I said the idea wasn't appealing to me for this reason. But the reason I asked the model to review itself is twofold. The first is that the content of the review gives some insight into ChatGPT's capabilities and what it can accomplish. It actually does a decent job highlighting its functions and even went into its limitations which was a surprise to me. The second is that by evaluating the strength of the review itself, we can see how well it accomplishes the tasks given to it. It starts the review by describing what ChatGPT is. This is an important part of any review, outlining for an audience what exactly is reviewing. It then goes into what the tool is capable of accomplishing as well as its flaws. Pros and cons are essential to any review as well.
<b></b>
        
 But compared to other reviews, there are a few places where ChatGPT misses the mark. For one, the conclusion doesn't actually tell the reader it's an opinion on its functionality. Of course, it doesn't. It's a computer program. Instead, it reiterates that AI is a technological milestone and could be used in new and exciting ways. But nowhere does it state whether or not it should be used or if it does its intended task to the expectations of its user all the time. This lack of ability on the more human aspects of a review, where emotion is involved, is quite the hindrance. 
<b></b>
        
This can be applied to the writing tool as a whole. ChatGPT can write you an essay on the Civil War a million times over, but it can't express why you feel a certain way about its proceedings. And when it comes to how good a writing tool is atâ€¦well writing, these opinions need to be considered. So maybe you can get a passing grade in your applied physics class, but can it really be used to write something that expresses who you are as a writer? And if your own voice is diminished, then what's really the point? In the end, ChatGPT has its function, and it's pretty damn good at doing it. But if you're really looking to write something meaningful, I wouldn't look here. And as a sidenote- ChatGPT didn't give itself a ranking, which is honestly a sin in the world of reviews in my opinion. So I'll give it an overall 3 out of 5 stars. 3 for your A+ grade in physics and a missing 2 stars that are probably in the same place your passion for writing is in a ChatGPT essay.</p></div>
