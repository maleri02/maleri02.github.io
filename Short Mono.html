    <p> Before I start, allow me to introduce myself. You have no idea who I am, although if things had played out as they should have, you wouldn't have been able to walk down a city street without seeing my name. I'm Guy Six. The youngest of the Guy brothers. You may know my siblings One, Two, Three, Four, and Five as eternal bringers of burgers and fries. Fast food icons as they are, Five Guys would have been nothing without me. You know that blood red color scheme (that honestly, now that I think about it is quite ugly if I do say so myself)? That was me! Wellâ€¦not really me, Three was the one who suggested the shade, but I sat in that meeting! I approved it! I sat in all the meetings and approved all the things until the day they said five just had a better ring than six. But who cares? I turned out just fine. If it wasn't for that little decision my brothers made with very little regard to who it affected, I wouldn't have found my passion in soil infiltration testing! I wouldn't have had the opportunity to experience my own wedding three separate times! Sure, they're sitting on savings the size of Texas, but it's not as if they're at the top of the food chain in their realm either. Last I heard, Wendy put a down payment on having her body shot into space when she dies, because what other way to show off the fortune you've amassed than to rub it in the faces of those forced to continue their nine-to-five's until they join you. Despite popular belief, Old McDonald does not live on a farm. He lives in a Bond Villian mansion in the Italian Alps. I don't think I need to go into detail on Burger King. I've come to realize it's not about the money, it's about making your mark on this earth. Something that will last long after you're gone. Maybe I don't have a fast food empire, but I haven't lost hope! The minor felony charges make it a bit harder to do anything meaningful with my life (really nothing major and honestly I didn't even know I was involved in a Ponzi Scheme) but I haven't given up! So if you take away anything from this, let it be that determination, that undying will. And if you take away anything else, let it be this: don't get into Bitcoin as much as those fun ads on the internet tell you to do so. </p></div>
