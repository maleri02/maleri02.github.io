    <h1>Who am I as a Writer?</h1></div>
    <p>When it comes to writing, I personally struggle with starting. Whether it be from a lack of ideas or working myself up to finally start putting words to paper, physical or digital, I struggle. So I figure the best way to portray this aspect of my writing is to skip the traditional "introduction" and just start talking about myself. <br>

    One of the first things I learned how to write was my name, as is the case with many five-year-olds who would rather be running around outside than practicing how to not hold a pencil in a fist. So, in the most technical sense, I spent a good portion of my life writing with my thumb on the left side of a yellow wooden stick with a graphite tip and my pointer finger on the right. This has since become mostly obsolete because high schools decided that laptops were the way to go. It was just a switch in the device but my shitty public school thought it was a sign of our higher intelligence so the move to fully digital was promoted on everything. Four years of the most degrading and harrowing experience of my life but at least I didn't have to put up with the paper!
	<br><br>
    I'm beginning to realize that this is a good example of the most common trait found in my writing, other than horrible spelling. I write in the same exact way that I talk. This means it's littered with my sarcasm, natural pessimism, and the direct effect of my ADHD: tangents. Sorry in advance for the rest of this class. 
	Despite this, I genuinely enjoy writing. It's been my favorite aspect of any academic environment for as long as I can remember. The response toward my writing has varied simply because no two people like the same thing. My casualness wasn't exactly what most of my old teachers were looking for and I found myself having a hard time not being offended. It wasn't like I was getting any feedback to improve on either, just a strict letter grade that may or may not has been affected by my 11th-grade English teacher's dislike toward me personally. Still have a grudge against that man. 
	<Br><br>
    Outside of school work writing is also a fun hobby of mine. It's not uncommon to see me typing on a google doc with my friends at night trying to see what we come up with. The genre varies, there are really no guidelines we follow just streamlines of unedited thought. That's when I find writing the most fun. I tend to only do this when I'm happy rather than writing out my feelings when I'm upset at certain things. I don't really journal or keep a diary. 
	<br><br>
    For the longest time I wanted to write stories for video games, but I still do really. So then you, the reader who has very little information on my life until now, may ask me why exactly I'm studying to go to law school. I could tell you it's something I'm passionate about, and it'd be half true. In reality, I've lost a lot of the motivation I used to have for writing. I still love it, when I do it, but I just can't seem to bring myself to as much as I used to. Becoming a lawyer just seems like the best option to me now. Plus, at least in my mind, it'll be easier to switch to something outside of that field than into it in the future.
	<br><br>
    So yeah, that's the overview of me as a writer. Fun fact: I'm pretty bad at conclusions too.</p>
